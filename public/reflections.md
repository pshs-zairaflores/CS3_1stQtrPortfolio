# **`5 Topics I know very well`**
## *1. Arithmetic Operators*
### This is the most basic topic for me in coding. The 5 basic arithmetic operators are literally applied the same way in all the programming languages I have used throughout the years such as Python, c++, and Javascript. I always use this in my coding exercises.
## *2. If-Else Statements* 
### This is one of the most basic topics for me in coding. I have already mastered this topic last year in Grade 8 using c++. I can easily apply this in Javascript. I have resorted to using if-else statements in my codes and somehow still end up with correct outputs.
## *3. Markdown*
### Learning how to format my texts using markdown is a big game-changer for me. I have already learned how to use markdowns in formatting my texts before it was discussed in class. Whenever I write stories/blogs, it really helps my paragraphs easier to read and the big block of words become more engaging to the readers.
## *4. Basic Loops*
###  The use of loops helped me to easily make and execute lines of codes repeatedly without it becoming as tedious as coding them manually with extra work using other statements. I had a hard time using do-while, while, and for loops in grade 8, but the extra coding practices were very beneficial to my grade and my skill in coding. I was able to master this by the end of last school year.
## *5. Declaring Basic Functions*
### Using basic user-defined or pre-defined functios in coding also saved a lot of time and effort for me in coding. Functions allowed me to reuse and simplify my codes.

# **`5 Topics I need further practice on`**
## *1. Using VSCode & Github*
### I have never ever used VSCode or Github before in my entire life, so everything about the software and the website are new and unfamiliar to me when they were first discussed in class. I was also unable to instill enough time for me to explore them at first before utilizing them for my coding requirements.
## *2. Javascript Syntax*
### It was quite overwhelming for me to see Javascript syntax for the first time because of the many symbols and lines. I think it would be better if they were discussed more comprehensively during class.
## *3. Nested For Loops*
### For some reason, I keep forgetting how nested for loops work recently. It takes time for me to understand the process of nested for loops. I think I need more practice to refresh my mind on this topic.
## *4. Javascript Number Objects*
### I haven't memorized all the properties and methods of using Number Objects in Javascript. I'm also very new to this topic.
## *5. Switch Statements*
### Although coding this is quite simple, I never really use it much in my exercises. Since I accustomed myself to using if-else statements all the time, I never really practice using switch statements a lot.

# **`My Plan of Action`**
### *1. Find time to explore coding in VSCode and using Github*
### *2. Watch videos to further understand the new topics*
### *3. Study the materials in Khub*
### *4. Practice coding using Javascript in VSCode*

# **`2 Most Effective Activities We Had in Class`**
## *1. Group discussions*
### Before the group discussion, I make sure to lock in reading and understanding the material/s asigned.This gives me a chance to be able to talk to my classmates and engage with them while earning sufficient knowledge about the topic.
## *2. Class lectures*
### I learn a lot during class lectures because I am used to focusing myself on the lesson. This is also the time where everyone in the class is also locked in and are listening to the teacher, which is a good learning environment for me.

# **`2 Least Effective Activities We Had in Class`**
## *1. Copying Sir Roy's code for the coding exercises*
### I automatically get lost whenever I miss to copy a line of code on the screen, and this happens quite often because my line of sight gets blocked by other computers. Also, the learning won't be very effective if all we do is just copy and neglect trying to understand what we're copying.
## *2. Doing coding exercises that are not due within the class period during class*
### I notice that most of my classmates tend to not finish or not work on their coding exercises at all during class hours, so they just start chattering with each other. I have a hard time concentrating on my work during these times because I am quite sensitive to noise, and in turn, I am not able to finish the exercise within the period.
